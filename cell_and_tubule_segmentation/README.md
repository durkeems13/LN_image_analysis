All code for generating training sets in the correct format, and training, evaluating, and implementing MRCNN is found in the following directories.

Two examples of training code are given; one for 512 x 512 x 3 images for detecting one class of objects, and another for 1024 x 1024 x 4 images for detecting 3 classes of objects. Training code can be adapted for different image sizes and number of cell classes. More detailed information can be found in the README files in the 'experiments' folder.

Trained models for detection of cells and tubules, as well as test sets of images, are available by request to mclark@uchicago.edu
